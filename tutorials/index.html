    Leaflet Routing Machine tries to give a simple solution to a complex problem: routing can be many things, and
    the user interface for various scenarios differs wildely; in the same way, most sites want to apply their own
    styling to the user interface. Leaflet Routing Machine solves this by comming with sane defaults: adding basic
    routing capabilities is just a few lines of code. At the same time, Leaflet Routing Machine is very extensible and
    customizable both in terms of functionality as well as styling.
